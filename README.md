I am a fan of film photography. I like the grainy texture of film photography. So I created this library designed to generate grainy graphics for Processing.

By randomly dropping dots on the canvas according to original geometries, the Grainy module helps to create grainy graphics. Simply replacing the basic functions like "line" and "circle" by "grainyLine()" and "grainyCircle()" will give you an amazing output.

This rough early version of this library was used in my project [Digi-Totem](https://chengkaixu.art/Digi-Totem).

More grainy images generated by this library can be found here: https://chengkaixu.art/Grainy
